# Upgrade & Rollback


## Upgrades & Rollback: imgbase

imgbase is the only new component with a larger code-base.
imgbase is actually a high-level frontend to LVM, enforcing a specific usage pattern.

In addition it has plugins to create boot entries for specific LVs, and some logic to migrate /etc from liveimg to liveimg.
